abuse & maltreatment of minors
Did you know that in some states, “maltreatment” refers to neglect and abandonment and term “abuse” is used for acts that cause injury.
Approximately 5 children die every day due to abuse. Individuals under 18 are at an increased risk of experiencing abuse and maltreatment when parental/guardian relationships are unhealthy as well as when people with substance use and/ or psychological disorders are a part of home life. Abuse and maltreatment of a minor is classified as increased behavior towards a minor that entails substantial risk of causing harm to one’s person.
There are four primary types of child abuse: Physical abuse Emotional/Psychological abuse Sexual abuse Neglect
Neglect is the most common form of child abuse, accounting for more than 75% of all cases of child maltreatment. Neglect is also one of the most difficult forms to evidence of and respond to. No minor deserves to experience abuse or maltreatment.
