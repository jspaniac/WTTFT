Birth Control & Pregnancy
You are the only person who gets to decide when you are ready to become sexually active. Being proactive with your partner in discussing birth control and sexual health is an important part of a safe and healthy relationship. If you think you may be preg- nant, it’s important to make an appointment to get tested by a health care professional as home pregnancy kits are not always accurate. In Washington State, minors of any age do not need
a parent or legal guardian’s permission to access birth control or pregnancy or abortion related services. If you are pregnant, seek emotional support from someone you trust, and talk with a medical professional about your options.
