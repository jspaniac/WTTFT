rape & sexual harassment/assault
Did you know that every 73 seconds, an american is sexually assaulted. ~R.A.I.N.N
It is important to know that experiencing rape and/or sexual harassment/assault is not the fault of the survivor. There are many emotions and steps that accompany rape or sexual as- sault. Due to the often aggressive nature of the experience and the potential for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or preg- nancy, it is important for a survivor to follow up with the emer- gency department at their local hospital with 72 hours. To help the survivor navigate their options, such as evidence collection and more, a social worker will often be involved at the hospital. To provide the best evidence collection, the survivor should avoid showering or changing clothes prior to being cleaned. You do not have to do any part of the exam you do not want. Additionally, the doctor can discuss medications that are available to reduce the chances of contracting an STI or getting pregnant. If the survivor is under the age of 18, the law requires the police to be notified. However, going to the hospital and submitting a report do not necessarily mean that charges must be filed against the perpetrator or that participation in a legal case are required. Counselors at the hospital or at the above agencies can talk about available alternatives and help the survivor decide what the best choice is for them.
