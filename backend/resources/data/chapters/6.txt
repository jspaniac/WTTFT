Affordable health care options are available to youth. If you are 14 years-old or older and do not want a parent or guardian to know you are seeking services, make sure to ask the agencies about their policies regarding confidentiality.
School-based health centers are an additional option for students. Visit your schoolâ€™s health center or talk with your school nurse for more information.
