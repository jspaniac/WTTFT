Bullying is harmful behavior that not only hurts people in the present but can also have long-lasting, negative effects on everyone involved. About 20% of students report experiencing bullying or feeling unsafe at schools in Washington State. Cyber- bullying can worsen these problems as bullies can antagonize their victims outside of school and anonymously. As of January 2020, Washington State law prohibits electronic, written, verbal, or physical acts of harassment, intimidation, and bullying (HIB) in schools that do one or more of the following:
Physically harm a student or damage the student’s property Have the effect of substantially interfering with a student’s education Are so severe, persistent or pervasive that they create an intimidating or threatening educational environment Have the effect of substantially disrupting the orderly operation of the school
Schools in Washington State are required to create and follow procedures that will intervene on behalf of students who are experiencing bullying, so you can always start by speaking with a teacher, counselor, or administrator at your school.
