volunteering & recreation opportunities
Did you know that people with high school leadership experience are paid up to 33% more than those without it. This wage premium is similar to one associated with a college degree.

For teens especially, volunteer work can help broaden their horizons, meet new friends, experience different cultures, or learn a new language, all while contributing to society’s needs.
If you’d like to learn a new skill or participate in a group program, camps and workshops are a great way to get engaged and build meaningful relationships. Listed below are community and recreation centers, drop-in groups, classes, and sports leagues for youth that are located throughout the Puget Sound area.
