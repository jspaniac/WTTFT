shelter, food, and hygiene
Did you know that young people leaving the foster care system are more likely than their peers to experience homelessness.
Homeless and runaway youth come from every socioeconomic, gender identity, educational level, and racial group in the United States. Minors experiencing homelessness do not typically choose to live on the streets. Many minors face a range of home dysfunction that challenges their emotional well-being, development, safety, and health, forcing them to live on the streets.
Drop-in Centers & Shelters
Drop-in centers, homeless shelters, hot meal programs, case management, and other services are available to help youth take of themselves and get off the streets.
Transitional Housing
Transitional housing offers youth a safe place to live while they work toward acquiring necessary life skills, self-sufficiency, and gainful employment. Please be aware that programs often have wait lists for acceptance, and most programs require a referral from a case manager or shelter program. If you are looking for transitional housing, please call your local 2-1-1.
