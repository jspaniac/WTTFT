Many teens have difficulties at school that are outside of their control and need more support for their education than what they can get at school. These agencies can provide a wide range of services to help support young people with their education goals, including tutoring, testing for learning disabilities, support for English Language Learners (ELL), and alternatives to traditional graduation, such as the General Education Develop- ment (GED) test. Open Doors programs provide graduation and GED support to people up to 21 years old. (OSPI)
