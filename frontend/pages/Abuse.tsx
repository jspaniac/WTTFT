                    Approximately 5 children die every day due to abuse. Individuals under 18 are at an increased risk
                    of experiencing abuse and maltreatment when parental/guardian relationships are unhealthy as well
                    as when people with substance use and/ or psychological disorders are a part of home life. Abuse
                    and maltreatment of a minor is classified as increased behavior towards a minor that entails
                    substantial risk of causing harm to oneâ€™s person.

                    <dt>Neglect</dt>
                </dl>


                <p>
                    Neglect is the most common form of child abuse, accounting for more than 75% of all cases of
                    child maltreatment. Neglect is also one of the most difficult forms to evidence of and respond to.
                    No minor deserves to experience abuse or maltreatment.
