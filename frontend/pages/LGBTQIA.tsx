                    Questioning oneâ€™s gender and sexual identity is a normal part of adolescence and growing up.
                    Finding supportive people and groups can be difficult, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,
                    Queer or Questioning, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQIA+) people are frequent targets of
                    discrimination, violence, and bullying/ harassment. The resources below are available to provide a
                    safe environment of understanding and information as well as promote gender and sexual acceptance.
