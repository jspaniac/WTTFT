                <p>The goal of Teen Link is to empower youth by supporting them in making healthy decisions. However, if

                <h4>Teen Link Help Line 1.866.TEENLINK (<a href="tel:1-866-833-6546">1.866.833.6546</a>)</h4>
                <p>
                    Teen Link is a confidential, non-judgmental telephone help line answered by teens each evening
                    from 6-10pm. Teen volunteers are trained to listen to your concerns and talk with you about
                    whatever is on your mind. No issue is too big or too small. Phone workers also have access to
                    an extensive database of resources and can give you information on agencies serving youth in
                    Washington State, as well as how to choose which one to use. After hours, callers have the
                    option of talking to the WA Recovery Help Line, King County Crisis Line, or leaving a message
                    on the Teen Link voicemail. When leaving a message, please include your name, phone number,
                    and information about your concerns. To respect confidentiality, Teen Link phone workers will
                    not leave a message when calling back unless you specify that it is okay to do so.
