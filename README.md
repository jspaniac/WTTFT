# WTTFT
A live web application for Crisis Connection's WTTFT booklet. The result is currently live and can be found [here](https://wttft.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
Currently, this respository is not set up for the project to be run. To see repositories with the correct setup, visit [frontend](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/crisis/wttft-frontend) and [backend](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/crisis/wttft-backend).

## How it works
The application uses React for front-end rendering and an HTTPS Java Spark server to handle client requests (primarily search results & resource parsing). The project was developed with a scope of minimal effort required in terms of updating for future versions of the WTTFT booklet. Although some knowledge of javascript and how the resource files are organized is required for such updates, a manual could easily be made!
